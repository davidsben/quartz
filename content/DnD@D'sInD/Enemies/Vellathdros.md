# Vellathdros, the Black Dragon
![[Vellathdros.png|600]]


*"The only thing we have to fear now is his Acid Rain" - Wunce*

Found in the forests to the south of [[Falstaff]], this black dragon enslaved bandits to raid villages and travellers, acquiring whatever metal treasures could be found to increase it's hoard. Vellathdros would often burn and scar his slaves to punish them and keep them subservient to him.

The Black Dragon was killed in an ambush attack by the party during [[01 - Acid Rain]], never getting a chance to speak, or even attack before dying on top of his hoard.
